Its a wet and weary night in Sumwear City. Two rather tall fellows, dressed in black, slink behind a local dive bar, their footsteps hidden by the patter of the rain. One turns and mutters something to the other, mouth covered by his brimmed hat, as to fend off any  eavesdroppers. The other gives a slight nod before they turn their backs and begin walking.
