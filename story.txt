It was a wet and weary night in Sumwear City. Two men, dressed in black, slink
behind a dive bar, footsteps hidden by the patter of the rain. One turns to 
the other and mutters something into his hat, as to ward off any nearby
eavesdroppers. The second man quickly nods before they turn their backs and
walk away at a brisk pace. I got curious so I started following them from 
a distance until they turned at a corner i started jogging to the corner 
not to lose site of them but as i turned the corner everything turned to
 black...



I woke up tied to a chair in a dark hot place filled with smoke. Above me 
dangled a single dirty bulb. "he's up" I look toward the voice it's them.
"what is this!? where am I!?". "SHUT IT!" the room fill scilent i 
couldn't produce a sound. it was his eyes they pierced my soul saw my fear
his voice compeled my weak mind to listen. By the time I snaped out of that 
petrifing look, another man was "working me" that what they calleed it 
anyways, it was more like tenderizing me. No questions were asked, just
 a hail of fists came my way until i passed out.


I woke up again...
