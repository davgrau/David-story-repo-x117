It was a wet and weary night in Sumwear City. Two men, dressed in black, slink
behind a dive bar, footsteps hidden by the patter of the rain. One turns to 
the other and mutters something into his hat, as to ward off any nearby
eavesdroppers. The second man quickly nods before they turn their backs and
walk away at a brisk pace.
